This repo contains the final project file for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on coursera.

Run_analysis.R is the file that contains the code to clean a dataset, including adding names and extracting mean and standard deviations from the observations, and outputting that new, tidy data set into a text file.

The dataset is UCI HAR Dataset, as specified by the course.
